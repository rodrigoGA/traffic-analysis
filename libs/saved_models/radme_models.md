# List of trained models

I added one model of each type:

- `seq2seq_00.h5`: vanilla seq2seq.
- `GAN_00.h5`: canonical GAN.
- `pGAN_00.h5`: partially adversarial Network.

The two GAN-based models are paired with their respective Discriminators, here reported with a `_discriminator.h5` extension.

These models are ready to go, even if I suggest to train many and form an ensemble, to achieve greater performance.
